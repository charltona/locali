The CWS however was responsible for the inspection and servicing of those munitions.

10774,Archerfield Aerodrome,"<p>Archerfield replaced Eagle Farm as Brisbane's domestic airport in 1931. During the war's early years (1939&#8211;41), Archerfield was used as an RAAF training facility. On 20 July 1942, US General Douglas MacArthur transferred his headquarters from Melbourne to Brisbane. Archerfield developed into a major United States Army Air Force (USAAF) repair and maintenance base. Planes serviced included: B-17 Flying Fortresses, B-24 Liberators, P-40 Kittyhawks, DC-3 Dakotas, B-26 Marauders. In May 1944 with the major US base completed at Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea, the USAAF gradually left Archerfield, returning it to RAAF control.</p><p>Archerfield also served the Dutch and British forces. In July 1944, the Dutch established a Netherlands East Indies (NEI) Government-in-Exile at Camp Columbia, Wacol. As Dutch transport planes serviced Camp Columbia, a NEI Transport and Maintenance Section was established nearby at Archerfield.</p><p>From February 1945, the British Pacific Fleet used some of Archerfield's facilities. The Fleet Air Arm occupied two igloos until 1946. A total of 35 wartime buildings including ancillaries such as lavatories and guardhouses were constructed during the war. The pre-war Hangars 3, 4 and 5 were extended. The Allied Works Council directed all construction.</p><p>The RAAF remained at Archerfield until 1955.</p>",381 Beatty Road,Archerfield,historic,Airfield,-27.5686,153.0085,,,,,,,

The Americans were not permitted to damage the racetracks so it was largely a tented camp containing only a few, temporary, pre-fabricated buildings.

10785,Australian Army Canteen Services warehouse,"<p>In November 1943 an Australian Army Canteen Services (AACS) warehouse, of the timber truss arch ""igloo"" type, was erected at the Atherton Showgrounds. Atherton was the centre of a major troop concentration on the Atherton Tablelands. After the war the igloo was purchased by the Atherton Show Society, becoming known as Merriland Hall.The igloo is situated within the Atherton Show Grounds, at the corner of Robert and Mazlin Streets, and consists of the corrugated iron-clad igloo (now the auditorium) and a 1958 brick frontage which contains part of the backstage area and dressing rooms. A weatherboard clad cafeteria with a gabled roof has been attached to the rear (north side) of the igloo. The igloo is approximately 200&#8242; (60m) long and has an overall width of 100&#8242; (30m), standing on a concrete slab foundation. There are sixteen trusses spanning the interior space, each made entirely of sawn pieces of native hardwood nailed together. A raised timber dance floor has been constructed in the front section of the building. Raised galleries, approximately 4m wide, have been constructed along either side of the dance floor for seating. The west side of the auditorium has been modified to include both male and female toilets in a narrow concrete-block extension.</p>",Mazlin Street (cnr Robert Street),Atherton,historic,Supply facility,-17.2692,145.4837,,,,,,,

10787,Australian Army Ration Stores,"<p>By the 1930s north Queensland had developed as one of Australia's important food producing regions, especially for sugar, bananas, vegetables, meat and dairy products. The seasonal nature of agricultural production meant that the region was able to take advantage of the available farm labour that had softened the impact of the Great Depression among local growers. However, the outbreak of World War II saw many rural workers enlist in the services, causing shortages in production. Added to this, the internment of Italian farmers as Enemy Aliens meant produce supplies were barely adequate by 1942, and food was severely rationed. By 1943 the heavy demand from the mounting number of Allied personnel stationed in the region outstripped local production and supplementary supplies of fresh food had to be obtained from Brisbane and the southern states. Storage and distribution of fresh fruit and vegetables was based around partly-prefabricated ration stores designed in Townsville for the Australian Army in north Queensland. These stores were basically a timber-framed and iron-clad shed with a low-pitched gable roof, sitting on a concrete slab floor with large sliding doors at each end. The sheds were open for ventilation below the eaves and covered with bird-proof wire-mesh. Most were erected on railway sidings such as the early Golden Grove butter factory siding opened in 1914 about two kilometres north of Atherton, where four ration stores survive. Of these, several sheds have been moved and modified for use as workshops and storage, but two still occupy their wartime sites.</p>",Grant and Grove Street,Atherton,historic,Supply facility,-17.2561,145.4776,,,,,,,

In April a landing ground site was chosen north of Augustus Downs homestead on the Leichhardt River. The cattle station was located over 160 road kilometres to the nearest railhead north of Cloncurry at Dobbyn, to which it was connected by an unformed track that was impassable in the wet season. However, a landing ground was urgently required in the region and construction was initiated by Burke Shire Council. By the end of May a single strip 6500 feet (1981 metres) in length had been cleared and graded. The powdery clay surface of the runway was consolidated with a thin layer of gravel and bitumen. A second runway running parallel to the main landing ground was cleared as an emergency strip for use during the construction, however no evidence of this strip remains.</p>","Augustus Downs Station, Burketown Road",Augustus Downs,historic,Military camp,-18.4648,139.8673,,,,,,,

10791,Babinda Public Air Raid Shelter,"<p>The former public air raid shelter at Babinda, built in early 1942, appears to be the most intact public air raid shelter to survive in north Queensland. It was built to a standard design, to provide seating for 50 people. The shelter is located in Anzac Park, on the south side of Munro Street, Babinda, where it now functions as a public toilet.</p><p>It is an above ground reinforced concrete structure with entrances at both the northern and southern ends, on the west side of the shelter. The reinforced concrete walls are 300 mm thick, while the concrete roof is 150mm thick. Internal blast walls form a corridor into the central space. The original toilet cubicles next to each entrance survive, although these have been sealed.</p><p>In form, the exterior of the structure has changed little from its original design. The interior has been converted into female and male toilets, with a dividing concrete wall erected through the centre of the structure. Apart from the addition of fixtures for water, power and lighting the only other apparent changes have been alteration to the offset ventilation vents to a more open style.</p>","ANZAC Park, 109 Munro Street",Babinda,historic,Civil defence facility,-17.3441,145.9209,,,,,,,
10792,Balfes Creek RAAF Landing Ground,"<p>Japan's entry into World War II led to considerable effort in aerodrome construction for the defence of Townsville from early 1942. An aerodrome site at Balfes Creek, west of Charters Towers, was requisitioned by the RAAF on 1 April 1942. Within weeks preliminary surveys had been completed and Main Roads Commission teams were at work with three strips pegged and cleared in the form of a triangle. By May it was apparent that during the urgent rush to establish airstrips west from Townsville along the Mount Isa railway, there had been considerable duplication of effort and overlap in instructions to surveyors and clearing teams.

Initial construction of the aerodrome was undertaken by the local Bowen and Wangaratta Councils with government advances. A single gravel runway had been completed by mid-1940 when the Department of Civil Aviation set about development of the airfield as a RAAF Advanced Operational Base. However, the site was soon considered inadequate for this purpose. Although it fell short of requirements for an operational base the aerodrome was taken over by defence authorities and extended, with a second runway being provided.

10855,1st Australian Blood and Serum Preparation Unit,"<p>A realisation that properly stored blood was a necessary adjunct to the medical treatment of wounded at the battlefront, led to blood drives and collections points behind the lines. In Brisbane, one of the earliest blood drives was made at the Brisbane Royal National Show by the Australian Red Cross in August 1940.

A small RAAF ancillary unit, it leased an office in 'Ryan House' in Charlotte Street in the City. The increasing volume of mail caused the Unit to lease further floor space in this building in October 1944.

This was the first death penalty handed down by a court in Queensland in 31 years. As the death penalty had been abolished in Queensland, the state government would not permit the execution to take place in Queensland.</p><p>The US Army had to fly Fernandez to Papua for the death sentence to be carried out.

During World War II, both branches worked together with the American Red Cross servicing US and Filipino personnel while the Australian Red Cross serviced other nationalities. When US General Douglas MacArthur transferred his headquarters to Brisbane (23 July 1942), the American Red Cross expanded its Brisbane facilities. 'Terrica House' at 236 Adelaide Street held its headquarters and main services club. Other floor space was leased in separate City buildings located in Charlotte and Edward Streets.

10862,Victoria Barracks,"<p>Victoria Barracks was built in 1864 and served as the Queensland headquarters for the Queensland colonial forces and then after Federation (1901) as the Queensland state headquarters for the Australian Military Forces (AMF). Over the next five decades, the barracks site received additional buildings. The major expansion occurred during World War I (1914&#8211;18) when 15 buildings were either constructed to or received additions. Blackall Street (now defunct) separated Victoria Barracks from the neighbouring Queensland Police Barracks.</p><p>On 3 September 1939, at the outbreak of World War Two, signals were despatched by telephone, radio, telegram and even across cinema screens to mobilise the small permanent forces based in Queensland plus the local AMF (militia) units. The inner-city, Petrie Terrace site had been effectively been built-out so there was no room for the type buildings (e.g. motor garages and workshops) required for the new war effort. Victoria Barracks retained its importance as a command headquarters but was responsible for the less-glamorous tasks associated with army administration or 'red-tape'.</p>",83 Petrie Terrace,Brisbane,historic,Headquarters,-27.4647,153.0148,,,,,,,

10864,Brisbane River Minewatching Posts,"<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941, Brisbane developed into a major Allied supply port. Facing the threat of Japanese aircraft trying to block the Brisbane River by laying mines at night, the RAN created a local minewatching unit. The unit comprised women volunteers who under took nighttime sentry duty. By September 1942, the unit occupied 39 concrete bunkers built along both banks of the river. Initial training was for 100 minewatchers but this number later rose to over 180 personnel.</p><p>More locations of the mine wathers posts will be mapped as they are discovered.</p>",39 bunkers along Brisbane River,Brisbane,historic,Fortifications,-27.4714,153.0223,,,,,,,

After being caught in a severe thunderstorm the aircraft lost compass bearings and went off course. It eventually ran out of fuel over the coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria and crashed near Moonlight Creek west of Burketown. Of the crew of ten, six survived after bailing out. Two survivors were rescued two weeks later by a party from Escott station, starting a search for the other survivors which lasted almost five months before one airman was found alive on Seven Emu station in the Northern Territory. The other airmen perished in the remote Gulf country. Today the wreckage of the 'Little Eva' lies scattered over several hundred metres of scrub with the wings and tail section still recognisable.</p>","Near Moonlight Creek, Escott Station",Burketown,historic,Aircraft wreck,-17.5704,139.6019,,,,,,,

The workshop was completed about October 1943 by the AWC and Main Roads Commission (MRC). Facilities included spare parts and material stores, also a blacksmith and welding shop. Bulldozers, road graders, tractors and other heavy equipment used on AWC projects were repaired and maintained on-site.

10870,Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) 20 Squadron Officers' Quarters Accommodation,"<p>A two-storeyed reinforced concrete building, the former Empire Hotel was erected in 1926 to replace an earlier hotel of the same name. Located across the road from the wharves, the area developed during the late 1800s as the business and administrative district of Cairns, comprising mainly warehouses, shipping agents, offices and hotels. The latter catered for local wharf workers as well as travellers arriving by the coastal steamers. Little of the district's early buildings have survived redevelopment and today only the Empire Hotel (re-named the Barrier Reef Hotel) and the former Jack and Newell warehouse remain to perpetuate the association of this part of Cairns with its waterfront origins.</p><p>The Empire Hotel was open for business by February 1927. It was one of a number of commercial buildings erected in Cairns during the inter-war period that acknowledged the suitability of reinforced concrete construction in a tropical cyclone environment. It was a plain and modest hotel and was used for accommodation mainly by business and working people. The ground floor contained a public bar, dining room and kitchen. The first floor was taken up with bedrooms and bathrooms. During World War II the RAAF occupied the hotel as officers' accommodation from late 1942 until mid-1945. The name was changed to the Barrier Reef Hotel in May 1960.</p>",Abbott Street (cnr Wharf Street),Cairns,historic,Military accommodation,-16.9249,145.7796,,,,,,,
10871,Cairns Aerodrome,"<p>The airfield became a centre of activity for refuelling military aircraft during World War II and continued to be used as a base by civilian operators including Airlines of Australia and Australian National Airlines. Little evidence remains of the airfield's wartime use although the footprints of the early runways have been incorporated into its recent development as a major international and domestic airport.</p><p>Cairns airfield goes back to 1928 when a local pilot, Tom McDonald, started operating his Gypsy Moth aircraft from a salt pan near the present airport. McDonald surfaced the strip with coal-ash, but he could only take of and land between high tides. By 1936 Cairns City Council had established an aerodrome near McDonald's original strip and work on upgrading the runways was carried out by the Main Roads Commission during the last months of 1940 ahead of the wet season.</p>",Airport Avenue,Cairns,historic,Airfield,-16.8841,145.7574,,,,,,,

10873,Cairns Transshipment Port Project,"<p>Cairns' wartime port development has all but disappeared today. Perhaps the largest US project planned for Cairns was the establishment of a major transshipment port to handle much of the war materials arriving in north Queensland from America. Initially the project allowed for almost two kilometres of wharves, 12 wharf stores, more than 40 warehouses, and drainage, sewage and camp facilities for 40,000 troops. Construction entailed dredging to provide a depth of 8.5 metres at low water and a large turning basin together with roads and railway sidings. Grand plans were incrementally reduced as the war situation in the South-West Pacific Area improved. The scheme was abandoned after just 250 metres of wharf and construction of seven warehouses and a reinforced concrete section of access road to the Smiths Creek wharves&#8212;which continues in use today as Aumuller Street.</p>","Smiths Creek, Waterfront and Aumuller Street",Cairns,historic,Naval/port facility,-16.9415,145.7678,,,,,,,

10876,Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Naval Auxiliary Patrol Head Quarters,"<p>Being located alongside the Navy workshops and stores, the club house played an important role during World War II. The RAN took over the downstairs area of the club house in 1941 as headquarters of the Naval Auxiliary Patrol, while the upstairs area continued to be used for dances and fund-raising events for the Australian Comforts Fund. Club members who were either too young or too old to enlist in the forces, provided valuable service with the Naval Auxiliary Patrol in assisting the operation of Cairns' harbour boom defence system and in harbour protection generally.</p><p>The club rooms remained a popular local venue for social functions in Cairns until the 1980s when high-rise hotel development began to take place alongside the building.

10881,Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Catalina No 11 and 20 Squadrons Base Camp,"<p>The steady drone of a Catalina flying boat taking off from the waters of Trinity Bay became a familiar sound off Cairns from late 1942. By 1940 a hard-pressed Britain could no longer supply Australia with frontline patrol aircraft and the government turned to the United States. The first order for a total of 18 PBY-5 Consolidated Catalina flying boats was delivered to the RAAF early in 1941. By the end of the war 168 Catalina aircraft had been delivered to Australia and they equipped four squadrons, various air-sea rescue flights, clandestine operations and communications units, and also an operational training unit.</p><p>RAAF Catalina No.11 and 20 Squadron base camp on the Cairns Esplanade, was ready for occupation in February 1943. It comprised rows of three-ply gable-roof huts to house about 350 men. The camp extended along the Esplanade from Kerwin to Minnie Street, where the orderly room, medical, dental, radio and operations rooms were situated. The site is now occupied by beach-front apartments and the courts of the Cairns Tennis Club.

10882,RAAF Flying Boat Maintenance Base,"<p>Japanese bombing of Port Moresby in February 1942 meant that a safer anchorage was required for RAAF No.11 and 20 Squadron Catalina flying boats operating from there. The port of Bowen served as a base for about six months until both squadrons moved north to establish their main maintenance and refuelling base at Cairns. In 1944 a permanent flying boat slipway of reinforced concrete was constructed on the seaward side of Admiralty Island facing the incoming tide. This enabled damaged aircraft coming in from the Coral Sea to run straight onto the slipway on landing.</p><p>Today most of these installations have rusted away or been consumed by mangroves, but surviving evidence includes several barges, an area of prefabricated steel wharf, and a concrete slipway.</p>",Admiralty Island -Trinity Inlet,Cairns,historic,Workshop,-16.9457,145.7813,,,,,,,

The USN ran its Base 134 completely independent of the US Army's establishment in Brisbane - Base Section 3. Sick and injured sailors were initially dealt with at a USN dispensary at New Farm. But as casualty numbers rose, the Commander of the US 7th Fleet authorised the construction of a naval hospital at Camp Hill in 1943. It was built on a large area of vacant land centred on a hill. Fleet Hospital No.109 operated until early 1945 when, with US forces pushing towards Japan, the hospital was dismantled and shipped to a Forward Area in the Philippines.

Area 5 was the divisional artillery area, in Petrie. This was bounded by the North Coast Railway, Dayboro Road, Sidling Creek, and Lyons Road. Area 6 (pumping station and Civilian Constructional Corps camp) was located west of Young's Crossing Road, on the south bank of the North Pine River. A large concrete tank remains there today.Most of the camp area has been developed for housing, but a few remnants still existed in 2009, most on private land. These include tent line mounds and a couple of concrete slabs in Area 1, east of Forgan Road, to north of Samsonvale Road; some concrete slabs in Area 2, located west of Ira Buckby Road and east of Kurrajong Drive; a deep trench latrine and concrete slabs in Area 3, south of Kremzow Road; a bread oven in Starling Street Park, Warner; and concrete slabs and a culvert in the northeast part of Area 4, either side of Kremzow Road.</p>",Various access areas,Strathpine,historic,Training facility,-27.2906,152.9381,,,,,,,
10896,Cecil Plains Airfield,"<p>Cecil Plains airfield was built in early 1942 for use by US heavy bombers, in case the Japanese invaded southeast Queensland. It was maintained by the RAAF but was not used until late 1944, by RAAF squadrons flying B-24 Liberator bombers. The airfield is located about 7km north of the town of Cecil Plains, to the west of the Dalby-Cecil Plains Road. Cook Road and Miss Jurgs Road skirt the airfield to its northeast and northwest sides.</p><p>The two intersecting sealed runways (45 degree and 135 degree) are still obvious from the air, as are the sealed taxiway that connected the south ends of the two runways, and the two sealed taxiways that curved from the ends of the 45 degree runway northwards to the NW end of the 135 degree runway.</p>",Cook Road,Cecil Plains,historic,Airfield,-27.4615,151.2095,,,,,,,
10897,"Charleville Airfield, Qantas Hangar and Norden Bomb Site Store","<p>Charleville airport has close historic ties with the birth of commercial aviation in Australia. In 1920, two World War I pilots, Hudson Fysh and Pat McGuinness, registered the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited (QANTAS) with the objective of establishing an aerial passenger and mail service between the railhead townships of outback Queensland and the Northern Territory. Early in 1922 Qantas successfully tendered for a new government mail contract between Charleville and Cloncurry and over the following months landing grounds were established at points along the route. During this period Qantas contracted the erection of aircraft hangars at Charleville, Longreach and Cloncurry. Today the remains of wartime occupation include the surviving wartime maintenance hangar&#8212;Hangar 104&#8212;which was retained by the RAAF when the US forces departed, and a small concrete shed, built in 1942 as a security store for bombsights fitted to US heavy bombers staging through Charleville. The instruments were removed from the aircraft on landing and taken to this building, where a round-the-clock guard was mounted. It now provides evidence of the determination of the USAAF to protect the secrecy of its new Norden bombsight.</p>",Mitchell Highway,Charleville,historic,Airfield,-26.4128,146.2584,,,,,,,
10898,Charters Towers Airfield,"<p>The Charters Towers airfield was constructed in early 1942 to provide dispersal facilities for the main Townsville air base at Garbutt. During 1942 the US 3rd Bombardment Group was based at Charters Towers, and from 1943 the airfield served as a US aircraft replacement and training centre. It is located on the northern outskirts of Charters Towers, about 1km north of the suburb of Richmond Hill, and is currently operated by the Charters Towers Regional Council.</p><p>Surviving World War II infrastructure includes the two main runways; a bore sight range, located west of Weir Road near the north end of the north-south runway; and a compass swinging platform, midway along the north side of the SW-NE runway. There are also traces of wartime taxiways and dispersal bays around the airfield.</p><p>The bore sight range includes a raised concrete platform approximately 15 metres square. An adjustable metal plate, which can be raised or lowered, is set at the front of the raised hardstand to carry the nose wheel of aircraft fitted with tricycle undercarriages. A cleared range extends east about 360 metres to the original earth butt.</p><p>The compass swinging platform, about 850m south-east of the bore sight range's hardstand, comprises a circular concrete slab 120 feet 6 inches (36.7 metres) in diameter with a compass rose inscribed on the surface.</p>",Corinda Avenue,Charters Towers,historic,Airfield,-20.0432,146.2722,,,,,,,

It was commandeered by the US military for use as the 84th US Station Hospital in 1942. The school and its girl's classes moved to the Royal Hotel at Richmond, west of Charters Tower on the 7 May 1942 and along with the boys school of All Soul's, the schools continued with large numbers of boarders coming to enjoy a 'Souls' or 'Gabes' education.</p><p>The school gynasium and grandstand area were utilised. A house from nearby Gordon Street was moved to the school site for use as the hospital. A large Red Cross was painted on the corrigated iron roofing to idenifiy the medical facility.</p><p>The American Military Hospital left the school in June 1944 and the students quickly returned. After the war, the school utilised one of the army huts as a meal room. It is now used as a prep room.</p><p>By the 1970s many co-educational classes were being conducted and by 1990 the two schools had merged on the All Souls' campus, forming All Soul's St Gabriels.</p>","St Gabriels School, 29 Gordon Street",Charters Towers,historic,Medical facility,-20.0632,146.2622,,,,,,,

There was the 2nd Australian Imperial Force (AIF) that comprised volunteers who could serve anywhere overseas. The Australian Military Forces (AMF) were the voluntary part-time militia that was the mainstay of the Interwar army. Constitutionally, the militia could only serve within Australian territory (including Papua & New Guinea). On 1 January 1940, conscription for all unmarried men aged 21 years or older into the AMF began. As a result, new militia training camps such as Chermside Army Camp were required. Chermside Camp operated from October 1940 to April 1946. It was the largest AMF camp built in Brisbane during the war.</p>","Ellison, Geebung (now Newman), Hamilton?and Murphy Roads",Chermside,historic,Military camp,-27.3785,153.0423,,,,,,,

10907,Cloncurry Airfield and QANTAS hangar,"<p>At the request of the Department of Civil Aviation, surveys were conducted by the Main Roads Commission early in 1941 with a view to extending the Cloncurry aerodrome to meet RAAF requirements. Contracts for the strengthening and extending of existing gravel runways and taxiways to accommodate heavy bomber and freight aircraft, and for hospitals, workshops and camps, were let to private contractors by the Allied Works Council on instructions from the Department of Interior. On 5 May 1941 a truck convoy of machinery and plant belonging to the north Queensland road construction firm, T & K Constructions, arrived in Cloncurry from Cairns by way of Townsville to commence work on the airfield.

Group air crew, ground crew and support units occupied all eight hotels in the town. As the American presence grew, Cloncurry shire hall was taken over by the US 33 Surgical Hospital in anticipation of combat casualties. It was occupied briefly by US Air Force Medical Corps units during 1942.</p><p>The shire hall was a comparatively new building on the outbreak of the Pacific war, having been built in 1939 as the shire office and community library for the Cloncurry Shire Council. It replaced an original hall built in 1887. The council later reoccupied the building which continued to serve as the Cloncurry Shire Hall until 1966 when a new civic centre and library was built nearby.

10920,Cooktown Aeradio Station,"<p>Known as the 'Civil 'Drome', Cooktown's first commercial aerodrome was constructed in 1937 to accommodate the DeHavilland Rapide biplanes of Australian National Airways. The airfield was built on an area of level ground at the edge of a coastal mangrove swamp. Due to the area being inundated during most high tides the facility required a long levee bank around its seaward perimeter and extensive flood mitigation measures to contend with rainwater. The areas surrounding the runway still became very soft in the wet season and pilots had to take care not to become bogged.</p><p>To assist aircraft using the airfield, Cooktown Aeradio Station was constructed at the civil 'drome by TJ Watkins for the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), also in 1937. The main station building contained two rooms, one the operating room and the other a store room. The station contained radio telegraphy and morse key equipment, and a compact cathode ray tube used mainly for locating ships. A large bank of receivers was tuned to local frequencies in use. Nearby were the transmission masts and several other buildings containing living and sleeping quarters, and a kitchen and mess.</p>",MacMillan Street,Cooktown,historic,Airfield,-15.4668,145.2236,,,,,,,

10924,Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) 44/56 Radar Station,"<p>During World War II radar was a most secret technology. It had been developed in Britain prior to the war and the details were shared with Australia and other commonwealth countries. Delays in acquiring British radar equipment, due to the demands of the Battle of Britain, spurred an innovative period of radar development by Australian scientists at the Radiophysics Laboratory (RPL) of the University of Sydney during 1941.</p><p>It was fortunate that as the war with Japan approached, there were in Sydney two very important manufacturers with the expertise to produce specialised radar equipment, namely HMV (His Master's Voice), also known as the Gramophone Company, and the New South Wales Government Railway Workshop. These two organisations were capable of providing the Australian air warning (AW) equipment, particularly the RPL-designed transmitter/receivers and aerials. However, in September 1941 it was apparent it would take at least a year for construction of the local sets required for each of the planned 32 ground stations around the country, including Cooktown. The RAAF order for British equipment, including the latest Mk V COL, was dependent on availability and delivery times were uncertain.</p><p>On news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, scientists at RPL began building an AW radar set by modifying the electronics of an experimental coast defence radar developed by the army. The rough but effective AW set was completed in a week and provided Sydney's first air warning system. The Australian-designed AW Mk I radar was developed from this. The AW Mk I was based on the same aerial array as the army radar, but with a simpler tower. However, the army aerial was built to maximize signals received from surface targets and was not ideal for air warning where high angle coverage was needed against aircraft.</p>","Hope Street, Grassy Hill",Cooktown,historic,Radar/signal station,-15.4607,145.2551,,,,,,,

Emplacement sites were selected for Turtle Battery on Hammond Island and Endeavour Battery on Entrance Island.</p><p>The original reconnaissance of Entrance Island was carried out in September 1942. Initially it had been proposed to install a battery of 155mm guns at Red Island Point on Cape York to cover the anchorage and close off Endeavour Strait. However, a decision was made to emplace a battery of 60-pounder guns on Entrance Island, which would give better coverage of the Endeavour Strait. The guns arrived on Thursday Island on 19 November 1942 and were installed on mobile mounts on the south-east coast of Entrance Island in February 1943. They became operational as Endeavour Battery in April 1943.

By the end of 1942 the townspeople had experienced troops coming and going, but nothing prepared them for the arrival of about 3,500 US Army paratroopers of the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment, more than doubling the local population.</p><p>On 28 November 1942, a week before the paratroopers reached Gordonvale, a detachment of the US Army 2 Station Hospital from Mareeba arrived and set up a 150 bed hospital, taking over the Gordonvale, Commercial and Central Hotels in the town's business centre. The Central Hotel was allocated for use as an American Red Cross Service Club.</p>",Gordon Street,Gordonvale,historic,Recreation/community,-17.0915,145.7872,,,,,,,
10974,Gordonvale Air Raid Shelter,"<p>A surviving remnant of one of Gordonvale's wartime air raid shelters stands in Norman Park opposite the site of the US Station Hospital. This reinforced concrete shelter was erected early in 1942 soon after Japan's entry into World War II. It was probably constructed by the Mulgrave Shire Council. At least two other air raid shelters were constructed in Norman Park during this period. However, both were of timber and earth construction and have been demolished.</p><p>Like most public air raid shelters Gordonvale's concrete shelter was constructed to a standard design with seating for 50 people. Shelters were built in the shape of a rectangular box with 12-inch (300 mm) reinforced concrete walls and 6-inch (150 mm) thick roofs. Where there was the possibility of debris falling on the shelter, the thickness of the roof was increased to 300mm. Between Mackay and Cairns, 57 public shelters were constructed during 1942, most in Townsville and Cairns. Only two now survive in the north, including this remnant at Gordonvale and a more intact example at nearby Babinda.</p>",Norman Street,Gordonvale,historic,Civil defence facility,-17.0921,145.7865,,,,,,,

10977,US 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment Parachute packing shed,"<p>Construction of parachute packing sheds at Gordonvale for</p><p>the US 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment</p><p>began in February 1943. Two packing sheds were built in Norman Park on the present site of Nos. 1 and 2 tennis courts of the Gordonvale and District Tennis Association. The sheds were constructed with towers at each end where the parachutes could be hung up to dry before folding and assembly. Between the towers were 15 sets of packing tables where the parachute packers worked in pairs, one on each side of a table. The men in the packing sheds called them the 'Parabelles'. On one occasion towards the end of June 1943 as the number of exercise jumps increased, they packed 700 'assemblies' in three days.</p><p>Most of the remainder of Norman Park was taken over by a large tent encampment of US Army parachute maintenance men. Only t</p><p>he concrete slab floor of the packing shed has withstood the test of time. After the war it became the playing surface for tennis courts Nos. 1 and 2 of the Gordonvale and District Tennis Association. The No.1 court was resurfaced in 1978 but the surface of the No.2 court is still the original packing shed floor.</p>","No 1 tennis court, Gordon and Mill Streets",Gordonvale,historic,Supply facility,-17.092,145.7875,,,,,,,
10978,Greenslopes Red Cross Hall and Hostel,"<p>These two timber buildings were built in early1945 as a wartime Red Cross recreation hall and an accommodation hostel. Used to provide entertainment for recuperating service personnel from the adjacent Greenslopes Military Hospital, the hall was a venue for films, dances, concerts and billiards and library services. Unpaid volunteers staffed them.

10985,Q' Australian Heavy Battery and Army Signal Station,"<p>Two 155mm guns were located on Hammond Island from May 1943 to January 1945, covering the eastern approaches to the Prince of Wales Channel in the Torres Strait, and an army signal station on Hammond East Hill above the battery was used by RAAF 36 Radar Station during 1942&#8211;1943. The site is located at the northeast end of Hammond Island, between Menmuir Point and Turtle Head.</p><p>The surviving reinforced concrete elements of the battery include two circular gun mounts close to the shoreline, about 80m apart. Each has a ready-ammunition store at the rear, with traverse walls on three sides. The western gun mount is set higher than the eastern, and two larger magazines are located between the mounts. There are also two searchlight installations, each consisting of a searchlight station and a generator room. One installation is about 130m northeast of the western gun mount, while the other is about 350m southeast of the eastern gun mount.</p><p>About 200m southwest of the gun mounts is a Battery Observation Post (BOP) on the hill. Nearby is a shallow gun pit for a 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft gun, its stone rubble walls lined on the inside with corrugated concrete. On top of the hill about 400m south of the BOP is a three-room former signal station with a generator room nearby.

10991,Causeway Red Light District,"<p>The existence of brothels in Townsville was known long before the commencement of WWII. However the large influx of American and Australian soldiers saw this 'service' expand considerably.</p><p>Townsville's ""red light district"" was situated in Ford Street, behind the Causeway Hotel. A line of timber 'workers cottages' provided services to Australian and American serviceman alike. This included African-American serviceman until most of these segregated companies were transferred to New Guinea.</p><p>The locality was named after the nearby 'causeway' embankment and bridge that enabled travel to the city.</p><p>Nine houses occupied this side of Ford Street in 1942. However, by 1952 there were only five. At least two were destroyed by arson in 1945 and one residence was washed away by the 1946 flood. In an effort to erase the 'reputation' of the area, several Ford Street properties were purchased and removed by Townsville City Council. In c1969 this section was renamed Brodie Street and with the removal of the remaining houses, became vacant land.</p>",Brodie Street (formally Ford Street),Hermit Park,historic,Recreation/community,-19.2731,146.805,,,,,,,
10992,Camp Victoria Park (Lower) - HQ and Enlisted Men's Camp,"<p>In 1942, the US Army requisitioned Victoria Park, a large public reserve spread across two Brisbane suburbs for a large administrative and accommodation camp. Camp Victoria Park was the nerve centre for the support services that backed-up US combat troop operations in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). The camp was important as the headquarters of both the US Army Services Of Supply and its parent command of Base Section 3. American servicemen lived and worked at the camp while Australian civilians also were employed there. In 1944, a few members of the US Women's Army Corps moved into the camp.

10993,USAAF B-24 Consolidated Liberator 41-23825 Wreckage,"<p>At 8.15am on the morning of 18 December 1942, a USAAF Liberator bomber known as 'Texas Terror' lifted off from Garbutt airbase, Townsville, for Iron Range on Cape York Peninsula. The aircraft disappeared into an overcast sky, but failed to make it. Searches were mounted, but by January 1943 no trace of the bomber had been found and its disappearance was written off as another small unsolved mystery of the war. By late 1943 the Pacific frontline had moved far to the north of Australia and the loss of the 'Texas Terror' had been all but forgotten, when two Aborigines searching gullies on Hinchinbrook Island for alluvial tin, reported finding some burned US currency in the creeks at the southern base of Mount Straloch.</p><p>Early in January 1944, over a year after the aircraft's disappearance, several experienced rock climbers were engaged to search the steep face of the mountain which is covered with dense tropical rainforest rising to sheer cliffs 920 metres in height. Most of the ridges are unscaleable and the only practical route is up the bed of a ravine filled with large round granite boulders displaced by the torrential rains of the wet season. The mystery of the 'Texas Terror's' disappearance was finally solved after the searchers hauled themselves over 750 metres up the southern flank of Mount Straloch and came across the wreckage.</p><p>The aircraft had struck the face of the mountain some 150 to 180 metres below the summit where the steep slope of the rainforest ends in vertical granite cliffs. The wreckage remains scattered over a large area with part of the fuselage remaining at the point of impact. An outer wing and motor lie wedged in a crevice above. An inner wing and landing gear lie in the forest below, with two motors at the base of the cliff. Part of a tail fin, still carrying the number 123825 on faded camouflage, lies in a nearby ravine. An aluminium cross was erected near the point of impact in 1960 as a memorial to the eleven US crew and passengers who died.</p>",Mount Straloch,Hinchinbrook Island,historic,Aircraft wreck,-18.4523,146.2823,,,,,,,

After training, the unit arrived at Horn Island on 26 October 1942 with twelve 40mm Bofors guns, Predictors, generators, trucks and other equipment. During the war A troop was positioned on Thursday, Goodes and Horn Island protecting artillery, and at the Horn Island airstrip. B troop was positioned alongside the runway at Horn Island and on the ridges overlooking the airstrip, providing protective firepower. The battery took part in inter unit sporting competitions, constructed a swimming pool by damming up Vidgen Creek, and took part in the rescue of the passengers and crew of 'Tojo's Nightmare'.

10997,1st Australian Camp Hospital,"<p>Due to an influx of troops and airmen into Queensland and the establishment of their camps in 1942&#8211;1943, some thirteen smaller camp hospitals were constructed. They were much more primitive than the larger general hospitals.</p><p>The 1st Australian Camp Hospital was formed in April 1942 at Reid River, west of Townsville, arriving to Thursday Island on 1 November. Here they assisted the 6th Australian Camp Hospital nurses, until moving to Horn Island on 4 January 1943. The staff consisted of nine nurses, a doctor and medical orderlies.</p><p>The hospital itself consisted of a hospital theatre, mess hut, nurses living quarters and a ward housing 36 beds. The ward itself was a canvas tent, with wooden floor boards and gauze sides with tent flaps, while all other buildings were wooden and camouflaged within the trees. After nursing wounded from New Guinea, aircraft and other assorted accident victims, burns, illness, and a myriad of tropical conditions, the unit was disbanded on 10 August 1944, with the 105th Australian Light Field Ambulance taking over.</p>",near Sherard Osborne Point Road,Horn Island,historic,Military camp,-10.5944,142.2949,,,,,,,
10998,26th Infantry Militia Battalion beach defences,"<p>The 26th Australian Infantry Battalion was formed in north Queensland in July 1939, made up of part-time soldiers of the Citizen Military Forces, also known as the Militia. The new battalion was headquartered at Hughenden with companies based at Julia Creek, Winton and Longreach. On the declaration of war in September 1939 the Battalion was called up for full-time training at Townsville, then Miowera and Sellheim, before being deployed to Fort Kissing Point at Townsville, to deter unrest by Italian cane farmers should Italy enter the war on Germany's side. In May 1942, after Japan's entry in the war, the troops of 26 Battalion carried out reconnaissance patrols in the Townsville district before being stationed at Kuranda where they were engaged in training until mid-1943.</p><p>In late May 1943 three company's of 26 Battalion embarked from Cairns to take up garrison duties on Horn Island and the surrounding islands in the Torres Strait. The fourth company&#8212;A-Coy&#8212;was detached to Dutch New Guinea to become part of Merauke Force. Little evidence remains of the wartime presence of the troops of the Horn Island mobile force, but at King Point in a small concrete ammunition store dug into the side of a hill by the coast, two inscriptions survive&#8212;'E Peel 15/8/43' and 'EW Plumb 15/8/43'.

C and D Company moved immediately to Horn Island, where they took up position around the airstrip, while B Coy soon moved to from Goodes Island back to Horn Island. The unit had been sent to Torres Strait as part of McArthur's Moultrie Plan for the area and took their place in the defence of Horn Island. They protected the airstrip and King Point area, and took part in the mobile defensive force of the island. Other duties included continuous training on Horn Island and Prince of Wales Island, wharf duties, providing thousands of tonnes of fish for the island's defence force personnel, supporting troops at Muttee Head on Cape York, and publishing the Horn Herald and Zero Post both very popular publications with the troops.

The fuel was brought to the island via ship, and delivered to the Horn Island wharf. During the Coral Sea battle, the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion unloaded and dispersed 7000 tons of aviation fuel at Horn Island in five days. During the early, rushed days of 1942 the fuel was not catalogued, or mapped. It became the 4 Works Maintainence Unit's job to locate, catalogue and map all the fuel dump dispersal sites on the island. They collected the fuel drums and organised them into hidden areas around the island.</p>","East of Airstrip, take track off Airport Road",Horn Island,historic,Supply facility,-10.587,142.2998,,,,,,,
11002,Horn Island Airfield,"<p>The RAAF's Horn Island Advanced Operational Base (AOB) was constructed between late 1939 and 1941 and was upgraded during 1942. The airfield, located at the northeast corner of Horn Island, was an important staging base for Allied air missions against the Japanese, and a stop-over for fighter aircraft heading to New Guinea. The two wartime runways (136 and 81 degrees) have since been upgraded as the Horn Island Airport's runways number 32 and 26 respectively. Surviving elements include some concrete-lined trenches and bunkers located east of the southern section of runway 136; and the aircraft dispersal area extending north-eastward from runway 136, which consists of two taxiway loops with dispersal bays, some protected with earth mounds. Two concrete Bofors gun pits are located on a ridge (known as Bofors Ridge) a kilometre east of the east end of runway 81. The bitumen surface of a wartime runway extension to the west of runway 81 remains intact. The area southwest of the intersection of the two runways contains a section of taxiway and five surviving dispersal bays, a series of concrete lined trenches and four bunkers intended for airfield defence and runway demolition (Strong Point No.1); several light machine gun pits, and 18 identifiable Japanese bomb craters. The site of the Operational Base Unit (OBU) camp is located in bushland immediately south of the airport manager's house and fuel tanks. Airport Road follows the route of most of the taxiway west of the OBU camp. Aircraft wrecks/components near the airfield include two B-17s on the coastline northeast of runway 136; a B-17 east of the east end of runway 81; and a P-47 Thunderbolt near a dispersal bay further to the east. Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) Gun Station 442 occupies the summit of the north-eastern of two small hills that form Double Hill, off Quarry Road, partly on a recent residential allotment. Surviving concrete elements of the gun station comprise a central command post/plotting room (CP); four in-ground octagonal gun emplacements; and three magazines. The fourth magazine has recently been incorporated into the interior of a house. The CP has been adapted as a swimming pool, and the underground plotting room has been sealed. The camp area for Gun Station 442 is located on the hillside 250 metres south-east of the battery. Gun Station 443, approximately 4.8km northeast of GS 442 as the crow flies, occupies an area off King Point Road near the coast of King Point. Surviving concrete elements of the gun station comprise a central CP; four in-ground octagonal gun emplacements, and three magazines. An unidentified building containing a concrete floor slab and underground room forms part of the group. Two of three reinforced concrete magazines are earth covered. The third magazine has been adapted as a dwelling and is occupied.

11004,USAAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress Bomber 41-2421,"<p>On 16 July 1942, Major Clarence McPherson and 1st Lieutenant Pencuick with seven crew were flying in a salvage crew of seven men with spare parts and equipment to repair another B17 (41-2633, later known as Sally) that had crashed on Horn Island a few days earlier. They were carrying a complete landing gear, wheel, tire and break assembly, two propellers, and a great variety of tools. This crash is the largest aviation disaster Torres Strait has known, with the loss of 16 men. Witnesses say the aircraft came in low, attempted a very steep banking turn, and then with the heavy spare parts shifting, the aircraft's wing dipped and slicing like a knife, she went into the ground. The aircraft exploded and was well on fire by the time rescuers' arrived, leaving them to helplessly watch as the aircraft burned&#8212;all onboard were killed.</p>",Horn Island Airfield,Horn Island,historic,Aircraft wreck,-10.5831,142.2959,,,,,,,

11006,Water tank bases (4),"<p>The logistical problem of the lack of water on Horn Island was so severe that men were rationed to one canteen of water a day. To rectify this, the 17 Australian Field Company, Royal Australian Engineers, began construction of twelve 95,000 gallon wooden water tanks on 14 May 1943. Grouped into sets of four, they were situated near the wharf (today in Wasaga Village), halfway to the airport, and a third set near Vidgeon Creek, all being supplied by a pipeline from Vidgeon Creek. The tanks were octagonal with 20 foot sides of sheet iron lined T & G timber, jointed into an eight inch reinforced concrete base. The supporting framework of local hardwood and the prefabricated sides were bolted together with bolts made up from steel rod. The trick was to ensure that all joints in the iron were watertight and the bottom seal was in place. Work was completed on 1 September 1943, with 18 tonnes of concrete used to pour the bases, which today remain tangible evidence of these water tanks.</p>",Off Airport Road,Horn Island,historic,Supply facility,-10.5924,142.251,,,,,,,

11008,Australian Advanced Ammunition Depot,"<p>Dispersal of ammunition replenishment centres away from Townsville during the crisis months of early 1942, saw the establishment of US ordnance depots at Torrens Creek and Kurukan, and a temporary Australian Army ammunition depot on the Hughenden golf links. During the latter half of 1942 a permanent Australian Advanced Ammunition Depot was constructed east of Hughenden, at Baronta siding on the Townsville-Mount Isa railway. In terms of size and extent, Baronta became one of the largest wartime ammunition depots in north Queensland, exceeded only by the US Kangaroo Ordnance depot at Kurukan north of Townsville.</p><p>The Baronta depot, extending northward from the rail siding, contained over 90 fibro-cement and corrugated iron ammunition stores located on concrete slabs; an administrative centre including offices, workshops and a brick laboratory; a camp area; a rations depot and railway spur lines. Today only the concrete slabs remain to show the extent of the complex.</p>","Baronta Siding, Flinders Highway",Hughenden,historic,Ammunition facility,-20.8778,144.5119,,,,,,,

ATIS established its Australian headquarters (HQ) there. It became the primary interrogation centre for enemy POWs in this country. The interrogation cellblocks remain on the site. Other important work conducted at the ATIS HQ were the breaking of the Japanese Army's codes in1943 and the translation of a captured list that allowed the Allies to compile a Japanese Order of Battle. ATIS left in July 1945 and the site became an Australian Army Women's Service barracks.</p>",203 Clarence and 9 Lambert Roads,Indooroopilly,historic,Internment/POW facility,-27.5047,152.9757,,,,,,,
11013,RAAF 52 Radar Station,"<p>RAAF 52 Radar Station at Mutee Head was built during 1943, and its surviving radar tower and aerial is the only intact example of a World War II Air Warning radar tower on its original site in Queensland. The radar station ceased operations in September 1945 and in 1947 the abandoned camp buildings were offered as emergency accommodation to the Saibai Island people. The site at Mutee head is about 8kms west of Injinoo, or over 30km by road.</p><p>The radar structure, on top of the Mutee Head headland, comprises a 3.4 metre high tower; a turntable and spindle about 2.5 metres in height; and an aerial approximately 4.5 high and approximately 9.4 metres wide, making a total height of 10.4 metres. The Australian transportable (prefabricated) Air Warning (AW) radar tower is of bolted steel construction, and the aerial is a five bay Australian CHL/AW type constructed of angle steel fastened by bolts and plates.</p><p>Two circular machine gun pits are located near the base of the radar tower. Evidence of a camp area extends south of the radar tower for several hundred metres, including remnants of the kitchen fireplace, kitchen and mess slab and grease traps. The concrete base of a large (80,000 gallon) water tank is located about 300 metres south-east of the radar tower.</p>",Mutee Heads Road,Injinoo,historic,Radar/signal station,-10.9103,142.2493,,,,,,,

11015,Iron Range United States Army - Australian Bakery,"<p>A bakery was operating at Iron Range by 1942 although bread was scarce. Initially this was probably provided by an Australian unit and the US and Australian forces may have joined efforts to make the baking facility serve both administrations. The location was noted by a road surveyor on a 1945 MRC survey plan as 'USA RAAF Aust' Bakery'. The bakery was situated in a rainforest clearing and contained four igloo-shaped clay ovens set on an earth base, alongside iron store sheds, water tanks and tent accommodation. Today the rainforest has again taken over and little evidence of the bakery remains except for several concrete footings, one inscribed 'S Hooper 5/12/43'.</p><p>The bakery site was located just behind the unofficial Iron Range post office which was built in 1936 for miners in the area, but closed during the war years. The post office reopened after the war and became known far and wide as 'the Green Hoose' after its owner's thick Scots accent.</p>",Lockhart River Road,Iron Range,historic,Supply facility,-12.7644,143.2849,,,,,,,
11016,Iron Range USAAF/RAAF Advanced Operational Base,"<p>The three airstrips at Iron Range Airfield were constructed between mid 1942 and 1944 as part a US bomber airfield. Gordon Strip has been upgraded as Lockhart River Airport, located about 4km west of the Lockhart River Aboriginal community, while the other two strips are abandoned. Wartime access was from a jetty at Portland Roads, now a 35km 4WD trip to the north.</p><p>Claudie Airstrip, southeast of the airport, is a bitumen surface about 2000m long usually covered with seasonal grass. Wartime clearing of rainforest is still evident as are bitumen sealed dispersal bays at the north end. At the south end of the strip a bitumen taxiway heads towards the longer New Claudie Airstrip, which was never sealed. The latter is parallel to Claudie Strip, about 1300 metres eastward. The strip and connecting taxiways are now covered by rainforest regrowth.</p><p>Two Heavy Anti Aircraft (HAA) 3.7-inch gun stations also survive. Gun Station 446 is located 1000 metres north of Gordon Strip, just west of a section of the Lockhart River-Portland Roads Road. Located in dense rainforest, known surviving concrete elements include: a semi-underground Command Post (CP); three of four in-ground octagonal gun emplacements (in an arc west and north of the CP); one of four semi-underground magazines (south of the CP); and a slab of the mess kitchen southeast of the CP.</p><p>Gun Station 447 is located 1000 metres west of Claudie Strip, in open woodland on a high bank above the Claudie River.

11017,Portland Roads Coastal battery,"<p>During December 1942 the Allied Works Council (AWC) received requisitions for construction of a coast artillery battery to cover the vital US anchorage for Iron Range air base at Portland Roads on Weymouth Bay. The work involved the construction of two 60-pounder gun emplacements, a battery observation post, searchlight posts, magazines, shell recesses and other works for the erection of camp facilities. The work was carried out under the Public Estate Improvement Program with PEI teams operating under the Main Roads Commission (MRC). During the same month requisitions were also received for construction of Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) Gun Stations 446 and 447 at Portland Roads, including two command posts, eight gun emplacements, shell stores and other facilities. The requisitions were confirmed in January 1943 and the works were probably completed during the first half of the year.</p><p>Today the reinforced concrete defences of the coast battery remain hidden on a hill overlooking the remnants of the wartime jetty. The concrete structures include a command post, battery observation post, upper and lower gun emplacements and two coast artillery searchlight posts above the beach. The gun emplacements now serve as footings for a recent dwelling.</p>",Portland Roads,Iron Range,historic,Fortifications,-12.6122,143.4374,,,,,,,

11019,United States 44th General Hospital,"<p>The United States (US) 44<sup>th</sup> General Hospital at Black River was established with 1000 beds. This could increase to 1500 in an emergency and the site was planned for 4500, though this did not occur. The location was believed to be ideal due to the natural landscape of the gum trees and the view of the surrounding hills. The slope of the terrain afforded natural drainage, unlike the 12<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> Station Hospitals in Townsville. The buildings were of a specially designed 'tropical type' to suit the climate and were shipped pre-fabricated to the site.</p><p>It was considered far enough from the city to be removed from noise, but provided good access with a sealed road to Townsville nearby, a railroad siding on the Cairns-Townsville railway within a mile, and the Bohle air strip four and a half miles away.</p>",Church Road (cnr Nora Road),Jensen,historic,Medical facility,-19.2316,146.6254,,,,,,,

The receiver console was housed inside a round concrete building, referred to as the 'set room', or 'round house' which stood about 200 metres north-west. The set room was originally equipped with four vertical aerials, referred to as a Marconi-Adcock Aerial System. Initially four trenches were dug, each 60 metres long in the form of a cross with a 7 metre high aerial in each corner. Cables were placed in the trenches, meeting under the centre of the round house. A length of heavy copper wire was laid out in the form of a circle connecting each aerial and when completed was covered with a layer of soil.</p>",off Flinders Highway (west of town),Julia Creek,historic,Radar/signal station,-20.6577,141.712,,,,,,,
11021,5 Australian Farm Company (Kairi State Farm),"<p>A part of army life has always been to complain about the food. However troops sent to Queensland during World War II benefited greatly from the early development of experimental farms throughout the state by the government's agricultural branch.</p><p>Farming had commenced on the Atherton Tableland by the 1880s and a few experimental nurseries and field sites were established in north Queensland to quarantine and disseminate seed and plant material and help farmers develop new skills and knowledge. Increasing demand for government-operated agricultural research centres resulted in the establishment of eight state farms Queensland-wide between 1897 and 1920, including two in north Queensland at Home Hill and Kairi.</p><p>The Kairi Research Station today forms a complex of farmed land, buildings and other structures that covers 244 hectares on the banks of Lake Tinaroo. Only a few structures of the early State Farm era survive. They include twin grain silos of concrete construction erected in 1918, a timber dairy shed alongside, and the foundations of No.1 Poultry Shed, the northern-most of four built at the farm, during World War II to produce fresh eggs for troops on the Tableland.</p>",Experimental Station Road,Kairi,historic,Factory site/industry,-17.2161,145.5657,,,,,,,

Constructed in 1942 by Queensland Railways to protect civilian and military passengers on the busy North Coast railway line, the shelter is situated on the southern end of the station's platform, on the west side of the line.</p><p>The air raid shelter is a rectangular building constructed entirely from reinforced concrete, 12.8 x 3.7 metres in size and oriented north-south along the platform. The shelter is accessed from the east by recessed entrance corridors at each end of the building. The corridors are formed from internal blast walls and turn 90 degrees into the main internal space of the shelter. It has an internal height of approximately 2.5 metres. The reinforced concrete walls and roof are approximately 300mm thick and 150-175mm thick respectively. Eleven dog-legged ventilation slots are located along both the eastern and western elevations. The southern-most access corridor has been sealed with a recent solid-core door and the northern-most corridor, accessed via two concrete steps down to the shelter, has been closed off with a recent galvanised steel security gate.</p>","Landsborough Railway Station, Cribb Street",Landsborough,historic,Civil defence facility,-26.8088,152.9663,,,,,,,
11039,US Army Round Mountain Detention and Rehabilitation Camp,"<p>The US Army's stockade at Round Mountain, south of Beaudesert, was built by the Civil Constructional Corps (CCC) in late 1942-early 1943, to confine US soldiers sentenced for major offences. The prisoners, guarded by the 345th MP Escort Guard Company, worked in the ballast quarry at Round Mountain, which was linked by a railway spur to the interstate railway line. On the spur line west of the Round Mountain Road, opposite Round Mountain, was a large 100&#8242; by 400&#8242; (30.5 m by 122m) ""igloo"" ration warehouse. The site is located about 11km southwest of Beaudesert, as the crow flies. Travelling south of Beaudesert on the Mount Lindesay Highway, pass through Laravale, cross the Logan River and turn north onto Round Mountain Road. The site of the prison stockade is on the right, to the north of Round Mountain. The camp's internal roads around the stockade, parade ground and guards' accommodation sites, to the east of Round Mountain Road, are visible on satellite imagery. Other internal roads are visible west of Round Mountain Road, near the ration igloo, HQ, water tanks, motor pool and poultry farm sites.

It was maintained by the RAAF but was not used until 1944, by RAAF squadrons flying B-24 Liberator bombers. After the war the circuit formed by the two bitumen runways and the bitumen taxiway linking their north ends was used for motor racing, with an Australian Grand Prix being held at Leyburn in 1949.</p><p>The two runways of Leyburn airfield are located over 5km north of Leyburn (northwest of Warwick), between Wirraway Avenue and Elerby Road. Liberator Place, which runs northeast from Wirraway Avenue, follows the route of a former gravelled taxiway to the south end of the 36 degree runway, and then continues along that runway (remnants of the taxiway also continue south of Wirraway Avenue). The 138 degree runway heads northwest from its intersection with the 36 degree runway, and crosses Macquarie Drive and Hamblin Road. A bitumen taxiway then loops northward before heading back across Macquarie Drive to join the northern end of the 36 degree runway, forming a large triangle.

The aircraft was carrying a temporary belly tank in the bomb bay, but ran out of fuel just short of Iron Range after a fuel transfer problem. The pilot had only two engines working when he set the aircraft down on the beach with the wheels up and some 800 gallons of fuel still in the belly tank. None of the crew of ten was seriously injured.</p><p>Personnel of the US 28 Service Squadron at Iron Range laboured for 36 hours straight in an effort to recover the aircraft. Frantic attempts to jack-up the aircraft and lower the undercarriage ahead of the incoming tide were unsuccessful. In the end much of the brand new aircraft was salvaged for use as spare parts.</p>",Quintell Beach,Lockhart,historic,Aircraft wreck,-12.796,143.359,,,,,,,

11047,Longreach Airfield and QANTAS Hangar,"<p>Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited (QANTAS) was registered in November 1920 and the first board meeting was held at Winton early in 1921. In the same year, the company moved to Longreach, a more central position from which to operate. The first hangar had been constructed near the site of the show grounds in 1921, but the contract for the mail service necessitated larger premises and a contract for a new hangar was awarded to Stewart and Lloyd of Sydney in March 1922.</p><p>The hangar was completed in August 1922 at the site of the new aerodrome, east of the town. Qantas ended its occupation of the Longreach hangar in June 1930, when the company's headquarters were moved to Brisbane. Qantas merged with British Imperial Airways in 1934 to become Qantas Empire Airways.</p><p>From early May until late July 1942 the hangar was used by the USAAF 19th Bombardment Group as a workshop and for mission briefing sessions.

It was used by two USAAF fighter squadrons in early 1942, before becoming a RAAF Operational base (OB) for dive bombers. After World War II the single sealed runway and its taxiway circuit were used for motor racing, before the runway was redeveloped as Daisy Road.</p><p>The airfield was bounded by Forest Hill-Fernvale Road, Coominya Connection Road, Mount Tarampa Road and McCarthy Road, while dispersal taxiways and 9 dive bomber hideouts were located north of Pakleppa Lane and around a circuit between Mount Tarampa road and Watsons Road. Another taxiway circuit linked both ends of the runway to the tarmac area next to four Bellman hangars at the southwest side of the airfield. Some sections of taxiway and most of the runway are now used as roads, while unused sections of the runway and taxiways are still visible. The concrete slabs of the four Bellman hangars and some camp buildings are also visible on aerials, as are the sites of bomb dumps on the west side of Mount Tarampa.</p><p>A semi-underground reinforced concrete Operations building was sited on the north slope of Mount Tarampa overlooking the airfield from the south, and a Wireless Telegraphy (W/T) Transmitting building of similar construction was built east of the airfield, to the west of the intersection of Rifle Range Road and Forest Hill&#8211;Fernvale Road.

Development of Garbutt led to the need for nearby dispersal aerodromes and fighter interceptor strips.</p><p>During March and April 1942 the US 46 Engineer General Service Regiment and the Queensland Main Roads Commission began clearing and building a string of gravel dispersal runways and fighter strips westward along the railway from Townsville to Charters Towers.

11059,Macrossan Airfield and Stores Depot,"<p>Macrossan, like most sites chosen for airfield construction was close to the railway heading west to Mt Isa. Situated on the left bank of the mighty Burdekin River, Macrossan was planned as an RSU (Repair and Salvage Unit) base. In addition the RAAF and Australian Defence Authorities chose to construct a significant RAAF stores depot in this vicinity. Like some others throughout the country, such as Drayton near Toowoomba and Dubbo in NSW, this complex featured larger warehouse buildings, very much with an air of permanence; i.e. meant to last post-war.</p><p>The very suggestion of design life for buildings beyond the anticipated period of hostilities was at odds with the American philosophy of tailoring scarce manpower and materials resources in tune with tactical advances being made northward and away from Australia. However, Australian authorities did prevail. Though delayed several times in target completion, this RAAF Number 8 Stores Depot was commissioned and the property at least in the late 1990s remained as an ADF (Australian Defence Force) stores base.</p><p>Two airstrips were cleared and formed to the SE of the stores base. It appears these were only occupied by RAAF Units and there, the ""hangar"" buildings two in number were in stark contrast to the larger buildings of the Stores Depot. The foundations for these cantilever hangar aircraft servicing structures are all that do remain and Roger Marks has so far failed to locate any war-time photos of these buildings at Macrossan.

Both the urgency of this work plus the large workload required by the USAAF meant that more civilian war workers were required. Brisbane was suffering an acute wartime accommodation shortage. A planned modern housing estate for married war workers, known as the Cottage Project was built at Moorooka in an effort to attract workers living outside of Brisbane. Over 100 cottages were completed before the end of 1944 with the total reaching 200 before the end of the war in 1945.</p>",Beaudesert Road,Moorooka,historic,Military accommodation,-27.5407,153.025,,,,,,,

As a wartime underground civilian hospital, built by civilians, it appears to be unique in Australia.</p><p>The underground hospital occupies an area roughly 20m square in the southeast corner of the Mount Isa Base Hospital grounds, and entry is via the Beth Anderson Museum building, which is accessed from Joan Street.</p><p>The layout of the underground hospital consists of three parallel east-west tunnels cut into shale rock, joined at their eastern ends by a 20m crosscut tunnel running north-south, forming a large reversed 'E'. A ventilating raise is located in the intersection of the crosscut and the north tunnel, and at the rear of the crosscut opposite the north and south tunnels are two recesses for cupboards. The tunnels are of varying widths, between 2.6 to 3.5m. The south tunnel is now the entrance for visitors, while the middle tunnel is now the exit. The north tunnel is still sealed.</p><p>Before restoration, little remained of the original furnishings and medical equipment.

11098,Inverleigh Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Aerodrome,"<p>Owing to the unserviceability of Augustus Downs landing ground after rain, the RAAF was faced with the immediate necessity of providing an all-weather strip in the Gulf country of up to 3000 yards (3280 metres) that could be constructed with minimum effort within a short period. Inverleigh cattle station, south-east of Normanton, was already equipped with a small strip from pre-war days, used by Airlines of Australia and other local operators. The civil strip was located on a well-drained gravel rise without overburden, west of the station homestead on L Creek. All that was necessary was to bring in earth moving equipment to extend the strip, provide a cross runway and form taxiways and dispersal bays. It was proposed to establish Inverleigh as the main operational base in the region.</p><p>Today Inverleigh airfield is unchanged in layout from the wartime years. Although the buildings-decorated and camouflaged in 1943 by Eric Jolliffe, then Australia's favourite cartoonist-have long since been removed or consumed by white ants, the airfield remains in use as the station strip and it's still possible to follow the taxiways and identify the wartime wind sock post, duty pilot tower footings and machine gun pits at the intersection of the runways.</p>","Inverleigh Station, Normantonâ‚¬â€œBurketown Road",Normanton,historic,Airfield,-18.0044,140.5356,,,,,,,

Two hard surfaced runways and substantial base and camp buildings, including a number of Belman prefabricated steel frame hangars were constructed by October 1943. Several RAAF Squadrons formed and were equipped with aircraft at Oakey before proceeding northward.</p><p>It is one of the WW2 installations which was judged worthy of retention after the war and current day it serves as the base for the Australian Army's Aviation Squadrons. Oakey was assigned a DCA LG # 871 in May 1947 and civil airlines use the strip.</p><p>It was to Oakey that squadrons returned with their aircraft at the end of hostilities for the process of demobilisation. It is the stuff of legends that during the months of systematic scrapping of rows of parked fighter aircraft that some were secreted and saved from the scrappers. Perhaps it is partly because of the presence of disused coal mine excavations in the area that such stories have gained some traction.

11108,Japanese bombing site (3rd Air Raid),"<p>In July 1942, the 2nd Group of 14th Kokutai (Air Group), Japanese Naval Air-Force, under the command of Major Misaburo Koizumi, decided to undertake night raids on harbour facilities and airfields at Townsville. In all, five raids were planned; three actually occurred. The raids occurred over three nights between 25 and 29 July 1942. Later code named by the Allies as ""Emily"", the Kawanishi H8K1 flying boat was an advanced design and regarded as extremely difficult to shoot down. Heavily defended, its armaments comprised dorsal and tail turrets cannons, with machine-guns in two beam blisters, ventral and cockpit hatches and bow turret. Not only did it carry considerable protective armour, its fuel tanks were partially self-sealing and designed that if punctured, fuel was collected and pumped into undamaged tanks. Additionally, the hull tanks carried a carbon-dioxide fire extinguisher system. With a range of 2567 miles, this meant that a fifteen hour flight to a target such as Townsville and returning to base was possible. The bomb crater is still visible and is located on Department of Primary Industry property at Oonoonba. The site can be viewed with permission.

Between their formation and May 1942, the unit spent time in Townsville, Bowen, Charters Towers, Barron Waters and Kuranda. B, C and D Companies arrived at Horn Island on 28 May 1943 as part of McArthur's Moultrie Plan, while A Coy travelled to Merauke. The Moultrie Plan saw a build up of troops and airmen to Torres Strait to support McArthur's flank on his northern push through New Guinea.</p><p>As there were not enough troops to defend Horn Island, a mobile defence force was established, with the majority of the men coming from the 26 Aust Infantry Battalion, while other platoons were sent to Goodes, Entrance, Hammond, Wednesday and Tuesday Island to provide infantry support to artillery.</p>",Bunker complex,Horn Island,historic,Fortifications,-10.5967,142.2953,,,,,,,
11110,Mount Isa-Camooweal-Tennant Creek Defence Road,"<p>A supply link between the Mount Isa railhead in Queensland and the North-South Road, running from Alice Springs railhead to the Birdum railhead in the Northern Territory, was first proposed by the Main Roads Commission (MRC) in October 1940 during the formation of the North-South Road. Initially a road was planned across the Barkly Tableland from Newcastle Waters to Camooweal, using MRC road plant returning from construction of the North-South Road. However, the project was shelved until March 1941 when the Army advised that approval had been given for immediate construction of a road by the most direct route from Camooweal to Tennant Creek. This road was named the Barkly Highway in 1944. The North-South Road was named the Stuart Highway. The Queensland section of the Barkly Highway has been realigned, widened, resurfaced and upgraded in recent decades. Bypassed sections of the wartime road remain, including reinforced concrete low-level bridges, such as at Spear Creek north of Mount Isa.

11113,Japanese bombing sites (2nd Air Raid),"<p>In July 1942, the 2nd Group of 14th Kokutai (Air Group), Japanese Naval Air-Force, under the command of Major Misaburo Koizumi, decided to undertake night raids on harbour facilities and airfields at Townsville. In all, five raids were planned; three actually occurred. The raids occurred over three nights between 25 and 29 July 1942.</p><p>Later code named by the Allies as ""Emily"", the Kawanishi H8K1 flying boat was an advanced design and regarded as extremely difficult to shoot down. Heavily defended, its armaments comprised dorsal and tail turrets cannons, with machine-guns in two beam blisters, ventral and cockpit hatches and bow turret. Not only did it carry considerable protective armour, its fuel tanks were partially self-sealing and designed that if punctured, fuel was collected and pumped into undamaged tanks. Additionally, the hull tanks carried a carbon-dioxide fire extinguisher system. With a range of 2567 miles, this meant that a fifteen hour flight to a target such as Townsville and returning to base was possible.</p>",Many Peaks Range (Northern end),Pallarenda,historic,Incident,-19.1931,146.7272,,,,,,,

Due to a colour bar ban placed by the local US military authorities, Black American service personnel (nicknamed GIs as in General Infantry) were not permitted to cross the Brisbane River and access the varied entertainment venues in the City centre. This ban, while not a formal Army regulation, was still stringently enforced by the all-white US military police. One of three American Red Cross facilities built for Black GIs in Queensland, the 'Dr. Carver Service Club' was both the largest and offered the best facilities from 1943-45.</p>",100 Grey St,South Brisbane,historic,Recreation/community,-27.4745,153.019,,,,,,,

In all, five raids were planned; three actually occurred. After the first two raids, there was to be another attack on the night of 28 July, but this did not proceed and no details were recorded. The aircraft destined to attack Townsville on 31 July experienced difficulties and decided to bomb near Cairns instead.</p><p>Later code named by the Allies as ""Emily"", the Kawanishi H8K1 flying boat was an advanced design and regarded as extremely difficult to shoot down. Heavily defended, its armaments comprised dorsal and tail turrets cannons, with machine-guns in two beam blisters, ventral and cockpit hatches and bow turret. Not only did it carry considerable protective armour, its fuel tanks were partially self-sealing and designed that if punctured, fuel was collected and pumped into undamaged tanks. Additionally, the hull tanks carried a carbon-dioxide fire extinguisher system. With a range of 2567 miles, this meant that a fifteen hour flight to a target such as Townsville and returning to base was possible.</p>","Northern side of Ross River, near oil tanks",South Townsville,historic,Incident,-19.2557,146.8364,,,,,,,

11175,Koala Ordnance Service Depot (Igloo Warehouse No.10),"<p>The Japanese advance on the coast of New Guinea towards the mainland of Australia in early 1942 dictated the necessity of preparing Townsville as a reserve base for the storage of large amounts of equipment in case of possible invasion. As the military situation improved after the Battle of the Coral Sea, its role changed to one of supply and repair for forward bases.</p><p>The ""Igloo"" warehouse remains as physical evidence of the Nation's wartime mobilisation in what was formerly the largest Allied base in the South West Pacific. As a purpose built Ordnance Igloo, it is the only surviving building of the Townsville Ordnance Depot.</p><p>The original design brief that these structures were to be temporary, combined with the ravages of termites, cyclones and high humidity has made them rare. The Igloo also features an attached saw tooth warehouse which was not a common combination.</p><p>The Igloo displays the principal characteristics of its type which include engineered timber framing, unlined internal walls, sheeted corrugated iron roof and concrete floor.</p><p>Due to the gravity of the military situation, Engineers abandoned traditional construction techniques in favour of a large scale prefabrication programme.

11177,Camp Tabragalba,"<p>Camp Tabragalba was constructed in mid 1942, on the cattle property 'Tabragalba', for the No. 1 Heavy Training Battery, the Anti Aircraft Training Battery and Anti Aircraft Searchlight Training Company. During early 1943 it was used for training four of the 155mm ""Letter"" coastal batteries, batteries 'M','N','O' and 'Q.</p><p>From early 1943 it was used by the Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB) to train Coast Watch operatives, and from late 1943 Tabragalba was home to Filipinos training to infiltrate the Philippines to establish radio networks and organise resistance to the Japanese prior to the MacArthur's return. Other personnel present at Tabragalba were from 'M' Special Unit and 'Z' Special Unit, as well as Dutch intelligence units. In late 1943 the property was purchased by the Mayor of Brisbane, John Beals Chandler, who had established the Chandlers electrical appliance company.</p><p>The site of Camp Tabragalba is about 6km east of Beaudesert, on the east side of the Albert River. The camp buildings were located to the north of the homestead site on a rise, and to the east. The entrance driveway used to cross the river at a point to the north of the current crossing.

11178,Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) 19 Replenishment Centre,"<p>The Queensland directorate of the Allied Works Council received a requisition for the provision of buildings and services for a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) explosives reserve at Talmoi wool scour west of Richmond in late September 1942. The work was to be supervised by the Main Roads Commission (MRC). At the time, Talmoi wool scour was owned by the firm of Edkins Marsh and Company of Ilfracombe, who owned a number of sheep properties and a string of wool scours throughout central-west Queensland.</p><p>The wool scour was located on Molesworth station near Maxwelton, west of Richmond on the Townsville-Mount Isa railway. The area was considered suitable for chemical weapons storage as it provided storage sheds and living facilities with running bore water, on a rail siding a safe distance from the coast and other settlement. The facility was initially designated as RAAF No.4 Central Explosives Reserve, Talmoi.</p><p>The work was given top priority with the design and supervision of buildings and services referred to the Department of Works engineers in Townsville. MRC roadworks and earthworks had commenced at the site by December 1942, but it was not until March 1943 that a contract for the erection of 24 buildings and repairs to an existing 11 buildings was awarded to J Hutchison and Sons who were then carrying out work at Cape River meat works, on the Townsville railway.</p><p>Today, nine widely-spaced reinforced concrete igloo-shaped explosives stores remain, with several floor slabs of other buildings removed, including a laboratory. The wartime chemical weapons stores now hold cattle fodder.

The camp, north of Rockhampton along the Bruce Highway and the North Coast Railway line, stretched from Etna Creek Road to Alligator Creek. Another I Corps Division, the 41st Infantry Division, had arrived at Rockhampton in July 1942 and was accommodated at Camp Rockhampton, between Moores Creek northwards along the Bruce Highway almost to Parkhurst; either side of the Rockhampton-Yeppoon Road before the intersection with Artillery Road; and south of Artillery Road between the Rockhampton-Yeppoon Road and Sandringham. Other camps in the vicinity of Rockhampton included Camp Nerimbera, Camp Thompson's Point, Camp Keppel Sands, Camp Yeppoon and Camp Wallaroo. The main combat units of the 24th Division included the 19th, 21st and 34th Infantry Regiments, 3rd Engineers Battalion and the 11th, 13th, 52nd and 63rd Field Artillery (FA) Battalions.

A vital part of the signallers equipment, was the switchboard, on Thursday Island the Switchboard Universal Call 10 Line was installed which was introduced as field exchanges for forward troops. When a person wanted to make a call, he/she pushed the buzzer, causing the circuit to complete through a relay unit to the switchboard on which his indicator light was activated. Whilst this equipment was fairly sophisticated, it did not cope well with adverse conditions.

11182,Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Fuel Wharf,"<p>Research points the construction date of the Naval Wharf and slipway to be the beginning of 1943, coinciding with McArthur's Moultrie Plan and the installation of the Navy Fuel tanks. Up until then, the army wharf (Port Kennedy) across from the Customs house had been used, however with the Moultrie Plan, it was envisaged that larger ships requiring a deeper draft would access the port and need somewhere deeper with access to the Navy's fuel.</p><p>The Naval depot consisted of the fuel tanks, slipway, workshop, which house, jetty and all portable gear and fittings. The slipway was 560&#8242; long, constructed of concrete foundations with two sets of rails, and haulage gear, winches and a Ford v. 8 power unit. The capacity of the slipway is approximately 400 tonnes. The timber jetty was 560&#8242; long and ran adjacent to the slipway, in a L shape, the head of which ran in a north easterly direction for 70&#8242;, with a 33&#8242; width. The winch house is located at the head of the wharf, slightly to the east and is of corrugated iron construction, while the workshop was to the west of the wharf's head. The workshop was of double corrugated fibre roofing and masonite walls, with a concrete floor and was approximately 150&#8242; x 50&#8242;.</p><p>On 19 June 1946, after deliberation, the Navy put the depot up for lease, which was taken up by the South Sea Pearling Company in June 1949.

The fort served no further military purpose after World War II. About 1954 a weather station was established within the fort, as part of a national weather reporting system. After the closure of the weather station in 1993, Green Hill Fort was presented to the Torres Shire Council as a public park and tourist attraction.

11184,Milman Hill Coastal Battery,"<p>In a move towards Federation the Australian colonies agreed in 1890 that the defence of naval coaling stations at Thursday Island and Albany (Western Australia) should be undertaken collectively.</p><p>In 1891 a colonial defence committee recommended that three 6-inch guns that had been offered by the British government should be emplaced at Green Hill on Thursday Island.</p><p>Costs of construction were shared between the colonies with Queensland providing a permanent garrison of 50 men. Clearing and excavating of the site on Green Hill began in August 1891 and the battery, named Fort Victoria, was ready to receive the guns by 1893. In 1897 a 4.7-inch gun was added at Milman Hill.</p><p>Rapid changes in European military and naval technology made Fort Victoria obsolete from its inception, but the installation remained operational until the garrison was moved to Darwin in 1932.</p><p>Prior to Japan's entry into World War II, it had been recognised by Australian defence authorities that the Torres Strait Islands could provide potential operational bases for foreign forces approaching from the north and in early 1940 it was decided to establish a system of seaward fortifications. In May 1940 the Australian Defence Committee asked for recommendations on the most appropriate site for mounting two 6-inch naval guns for Torres Strait. A recommendation was made to install the guns at Tucker Point on Goods Island from where they could cover the Prince of Wales Channel and Normanby Sound as well as the eastern and western approaches to Thursday Island and the airfield on Horn Island. It was also recommended that the 4.7-inch gun be re-instated at Milman Hill on Thursday Island. The main role of Thursday Island was as an administrative base for Torres Strait Force. The role of the troops on the island was the denial to the Japanese of the sea channels covered by the Milman Battery and the defence of the military installations on the island.</p><p>Today the World War II Battery Observation Post (BOP) on top of Milman Hill is fenced within a more recent transmission facility. The BOP is of reinforced concrete with a ground-level observation post and below-ground control centre. Two reinforced concrete searchlight posts-each with its generator shed-are located below, facing towards Horn Island. One is now locally known as Lions Lookout.</p>","Milman Hill, Waiben",Thursday Island,historic,Fortifications,-10.5786,142.2267,,,,,,,
11185,Naval Fuel Storage Tanks,"<p>In junction with McArthur's Moultrie Plan for Torres Strait of May 1943, which saw the reinforcement and defence of the area and the northern sea lanes, a proposal was forwarded for three fuel tanks on Thursday Island to cater for increased allied naval traffic. One 2000 ton oil tank for diesel distillate piping to be led to a suitable fuelling point clear of the existing deep water birth, and two 2500 tonne tanks for furnace and marine oil, with separate pipelines going to the main wharf of Port Kennedy. They were located on a Defence Purpose reserve adjacent to Summers Street with pipelines running down Hastings St to the main jetty, with tank 1 being of reinforced concrete and 2500 tonnes, while tanks 2 and 3 were of welded steel construction with 2000 tonnes capacity. All tanks were dug into Milman Hill providing excellent camouflage.</p>",Summers Street,Thursday Island,historic,Supply facility,-10.5788,142.2234,,,,,,,
11186,Torres Force Headquarters and Commander's residence,"<p>Waibene, or Thursday Island, is located in the Torres Strait and was once a gateway to the colony of Queensland. A two-storey masonry and stucco building was constructed here for the Australian Customs Department in 1938. Designed by the Commonwealth Department of Works, it replaced an earlier colonial customs house.</p><p>World War II was declared soon after the completion of the new customs house and in 1942, after Japan's entry into the war, the Australian Army took control of it as the residence of the commander of Torres Force for the duration of the war. The building was returned to the Customs Department in 1946 when military control of Thursday Island ended. Since then the Customs House has been used continuously by the Australian Customs Service, although due to the need for increased office space it no longer provides residential accommodation.</p>",2 Victoria Parade,Thursday Island,historic,Headquarters,-10.5849,142.2209,,,,,,,

It later became the Court House for Thursday Island and during World War Two became the Torres Strait Force Headquarters. It was described by the officers as 'the office', and has changed little since 1942. It is a house built up off the ground, with a wide veranda along three sides allowing the breeze off the water to flow, and quite comfortably furnished. One advantage to the officers was that it was far enough away from 'the main show' as they described it to make the officers more or less independent - something they saw as an advantage.</p>",,Thursday Island,historic,Military camp,-10.578,142.2187,,,,,,,
11188,Camp Maryborough,"<p>Camp Maryborough, south of Tinana, was built as a divisional camp for the US Army's 27th Infantry Division, due to arrive in November 1943. Construction was ordered on 31 July 1943, but as Camp Maryborough was only half finished by November, construction continued as a lower priority to the end of January 1944.</p><p>However, the 27th Division did not come to Queensland, and the two US Divisions which did arrive in Queensland during 1943, the 1st Cavalry Division and the 24th Infantry Division, were sent to Camp Strathpine near Brisbane (in June-July) and Camp Caves near Rockhampton (in September) respectively. The vacant Camp Maryborough appears to have been used by the RAAF as a bivouac site for No.6 Recruit Depot during 1945.</p><p>A camp site for one division was located south of Tinana, between Teddington Road and Tinana Creek, with positions for support units marked out between Woongool Road and Iindah Road East; for artillery units and Tank Destroyers between Iindah Road East and McDonald Road; and for three infantry regiments from McDonald Road south almost to the intersection of Teddington Road and Six Mile Road East. A possible campsite for a second division was indicated on a map west of Teddington Road to the Bruce Highway, with areas for additional troops south of the above camps.</p><p>Like Camp Cable (between Logan Village and Tamborine) Camp Maryborough was a tented camp, with more permanent buildings for kitchens, recreation rooms, stores, ablution blocks and the like. The Queensland Main Roads Commission laid down about 25 miles (40km) of gravelled roadway in the area of the camp and the main approaches. Roads and paths were also constructed for a 500 bed hospital.</p><p>Some concrete slabs survive, along with pit trench latrines, on private land.

11190,13 Australian Advanced Ordnance Depot,"<p>From December 1942 the headquarters of the Australian Army in north Queensland transferred from Townsville to the Atherton Tableland with the main administrative centre around the town of Atherton and the nearby settlement of Tolga. A huge schedule of construction work under the direction of the Allied Works Council commenced, involving the building of tent encampments, hutments, mess kitchens, hospitals and storage sheds.</p><p>Stores and equipment had to be provided for troops training on the Tableland, also replacement of lost or worn-out clothing, equipment and weapons for troops of the Australian Imperial Force units of the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions returning from the Middle East and New Guinea. What was to become the largest Australian Army storage and repair centre on the Tableland was established on a hillslope west of Tolga, early in 1943. Known as 13 Australian Advanced Ordnance Depot (AAOD), the complex consisted of about 150 buildings, including 18 large igloo storage sheds, an attached vehicle park, salvage area and workshops. The centre of the site is located between present Griffin Road and Tate Road, Tolga.</p><p>Most buildings were removed after the closure of the depot in 1946 and the area reverted to farm and grazing land. Today the concrete slab floors of eight igloo storage sheds remain, with others having been removed recently to make way for an expanding housing precinct. An early farm house which has been relocated onto a slab, was used during the war as a AAOD officers' quarters.</p>",Tate Road,Tolga,historic,Supply facility,-17.2195,145.4689,,,,,,,

The former WWII RAAF 220 Radar Station stands at the summit of a timbered hill called Bones Knob, located about 3km west of Tolga.</p><p>Surviving elements at Bones Knob comprise two concrete igloo buildings, a smaller concrete igloo, and concrete and steel footings of one radar tower. The two main semi-circular reinforced concrete igloos are 11.20 metres long by 7 metres wide, and are spaced 55 metres apart in parallel alignment. Attached to one is a small lean-to. Entrances to both igloos are sheltered under recent bow-roof verandahs. A smaller reinforced concrete igloo, probably for a generator, is located about 250 metres south of the transmitter and receiver igloos.</p><p>A timber tower over 40m high was originally located alongside each igloo. Only the base of the northern tower was visible in 2007. The tower footings comprise four 1 metre square concrete foundations, each containing two steel members about 1.5 metres in height.</p>","Bones Knob, Bowcock Road",Tolga,historic,Radar/signal station,-17.2167,145.4448,,,,,,,
11192,Toogoolawah Airfield,"<p>Known during the war years as Toogoolawah this pair of intersecting strips survives albeit with foreshortened runways today under the name of Watts Bridge (Memorial) Airfield. It doesn't appear to have been so named during the war years, although the Military Survey Mapping dated 1943 shows a nearby bridge over the Brisbane River as Watts Bridge. The site was chosen primarily as a base for an RAAF Army Cooperation Squadron activity. Indeed No.5 Squadron did occupy the airfield for some months prior to moving to North Queensland and beyond.</p><p>No substantial buildings appear to have been constructed during war service, although records do suggest remnants of a CCC camp remained at site for some time.</p><p>Significantly, the natural earth at this site suggested to the designers a cost saving opportunity by way of employing, then early technology, cement stabilisation. While the intention was good the authority eventually opted for traditional importation and construction of gravelled pavements. The fact that good care was taken to install drainage for the main 120deg runway has proven an important factor in the present day use. Bitumen sealing was never carried out here and with significant period of low use the gravelled pavement became well grassed over.</p><p>The Watts Bridge Memorial Airfield is well used by private recreational flying organisations and a degree of take-up by leases of air chalet allotments has occurred. Money is always a problem and hence the road and drainage infrastructure is still troubled through periods of high traffic such as the traditional last weekend in August when the Queensland Vintage Aeroplane Group - Australian Flying Museum mounts its Festival of Flight.</p>",Mount-Beppo Road,Toogoolawah,historic,Airfield,-27.1036,152.4334,,,,,,,
11193,"RAAF 210 Radar Station, Toorbul","<p>RAAF 210 at Toorbul became operational in early 1944, and was one of five British-designed Advanced Chain Overseas (ACO) radar stations constructed in Queensland during World War II: four being completed (Benowa, Toorbul, Bones Knob and Charlie's Hill) with a fifth not completed (Paluma). Two large concrete igloos are visible about 100m to the east of Volz Road, about half a kilometre south of Pumicestone Road.</p><p>The igloos, which are about 55m apart, measure about 10m long by 7m wide, Each has a large doorway at the west end, and a tower to the east. About 10m to the north of the northern igloo, and 10 metres to the south of the southern igloo, are the concrete footings for the timber receiving and transmitting towers, which were over 40m high. The footings are approximately 1.5 m x 1.5 m with remnant steel supports. There is a circular concrete feature within the northern tower footings, and there are several square concrete holes around the site.</p><p>Two smaller concrete igloos, orientated north-south and measuring about 5m long by 4m wide, are located about 15m into the trees west of Volz road. These contained the diesel-powered generators for the station. The southern generator igloo is level with a line about half way between the two large radar igloos.</p>",1295 Pumicestone Road,Toorbul,historic,Radar/signal station,-27.0397,153.0516,,,,,,,

11196,"United States of America Air Force Aerodrome, Torrens Creek","<p>Construction of a dispersed bomber field between Hughenden and Charters Towers was called for early in 1942 and a suitable site was selected at Torrens Creek on the Townsville-Mount Isa railway, where work began in March 1942. Personnel of the US 46th Engineer General Service Regiment cleared and levelled the Torrens Creek runways each 7000 feet (2133 metres) in length for the use of heavy bombers. On the main runway, running parallel with the railway, a pieced steel plank (PSP) mat was placed over the middle section to ensure the airfield was capable of all-weather use. This use of PSP appears to be the first of importance in the South-West Pacific Area. The matting was removed as the war effort moved on. Torrens Creek airfield was visited by US congressman, and future American president, Lyndon Johnson, in June 1942, while on a brief tour of the South-West Pacific Area. Johnson noted that the main runway was made of steel mat. While returning from Port Moresby, a faulty compass adjustment caused the congressional party's aircraft to make an unscheduled landing at Carisbrooke station south of Winton.</p>",Flinders Highway,Torrens Creek,historic,Airfield,-20.7837,145.0053,,,,,,,

Access is via Yarrabah Road and then to the end of the Esplanade (past Second Bay), followed by a 45 minute walk north past Sunny Bay to the tip of False Cape.</p><p>Two concrete gun emplacements survive at the tip of the cape. Each has a circular (incomplete circle) concrete mount, with a cantilevered roof and magazine areas to the rear. In addition, a separate concrete magazine is located to the south, with a corridor around three sides of two rooms. A steel anti-aircraft gun mount is located above the magazine.</p><p>A two-level concrete Command Post (CP) is situated on the ridge southeast of the gun emplacements and magazine. Above the access road on the west side of the cape is the cutting where supplies were once winched up to the CP, and below the road there is a pathway to the site of the stone jetty.</p><p>Evidence of the camp site at Sunny Bay, where huts were located to the north and south of Sunny Creek, include some concrete slabs and a concrete road culvert over Sunny Creek. A concrete rainwater tank is located on the ridge midway between the former camp site and the cape.</p>",False Cape,East Trinity,historic,Fortifications,-16.8723,145.8492,,,,,,,
11233,6th Australian Camp Hospital,"<p>Due to an influx of troops and airmen into Queensland and the establishment of their camps in 1942&#8211;1943, some thirteen smaller camp hospitals were constructed. They were much more primitive than the larger general hospitals, though Thursday Island certainly had the advantage as they took over the use of the existing civilian hospital. During October 1941, the Army began investigating the usage of the Thursday Island hospital to house defence force personnel, however the existing hospital required urgent upgrades to existing equipment and extensions to allow extra beds. It was seen to be more economical to update the existing hospital and not build an entirely new one. A new ward and operating theatre were constructed between Feb and March 1942, bringing the capacity of the hospital to 67 beds. Two civilian nurses at the hospital joined the service and became nursing sisters, joined by seven others from south to constitute the nursing staff of the 6 Australian Camp Hospital.</p>",Douglas Street,Thursday Island,historic,Military camp,-10.5817,142.2253,,,,,,,

It consisted of one 70 degree, 1.28km long, graded, rolled and grassed airstrip. A camouflaged arch type hideout, suitable for fighters, appears to have been the only structure built.</p><p>The east end of the airstrip terminated at the west side of Loganlea road. Its western end, which crossed Kingston Road and caused a deviation which is now Beutel Road, terminated between today's Beutel street and Alford Street. The formation of the airstrip is no longer visible in aerial photographs.</p>",West of Loganlea Road (in the vicinity of Kingston Road),Waterford West,historic,Airfield,-27.6887,153.1333,,,,,,,
11239,2/2nd Australian General Hospital,"<p>After returning from service in Egypt with the Australian Imperial Force, the personnel of the 2/2 Australian General Hospital were transferred to a new tent hospital at the remote Watten railway siding south of Hughenden.</p><p>The hot, humid, dusty conditions made living and nursing difficult. Selection of the hospital site on an area of soft, boggy black soil had been criticised by the building surveyor, who asked for confirmation of his instructions, saying that if the hospital were built there 'it would be the joke of the district'. However, the Department of Interior confirmed that it was to be built on the site selected for strategic reasons, the location having been chosen by senior Army officials.</p><p>In late 1942, some months after the arrival of the 2/2 AGH, the hospital was devastated by a cyclonic storm and was abandoned after tents were blown down and the whole area flooded. Rows of concrete floor slabs and gravelled roads now mark the extent of the Watten general hospital site.</p>","Watten Siding, Hughenden-Winton Road",Watten,historic,Military camp,-21.4394,144.2706,,,,,,,

11241,United States Naval Anti-Aircraft Training School (Wellington Point),"<p>The United States Navy (USN) operated an Anti-Aircraft (A-A) gunnery school at Wellington Point during 1943 and 1944. A detail survey of the Wellington Point reserve, a popular recreational area, was made in late March 1943, and this shows the existing reserve buildings, including a kiosk, shelter sheds and jetty. Although locals were not allowed on the site during the USN occupation, they could still use the jetty.</p><p>In April 1943 17 huts were requested from the Allied Works Council, to be built by Hancock and Gore for the USN at Wellington Point. A series of gun pits were also built along the north east shoreline.</p><p>During gunnery practice, aircraft towed large silk drogue targets over the area. These were dropped into the sea after the practice shoots, and a number of local women apparently obtained some much sought after silk as a result.</p>",Main Road,Wellington Point,historic,Military camp,-27.4658,153.2402,,,,,,,
11242,Air raid shelters,"<p>In the early 1930s, Townsville City Council constructed a series of drainage works across the city to alleviate wet season flooding and erosion. The suburb of West End received a major storm water drain to alleviate runoff from Castle Hill. This runs through properties in Echlin Street, beneath Ingham Road and the Show Grounds and empties into a nearby canal.</p><p>The Echlin Street drain would fulfill an additional role that city engineers never envisaged. West End residents took full advantage of both the Northern dry season and their solid construction, using them as unofficial air raid shelters on at least three occasions.</p><p>In July 1942, the 2nd Group of 14th Kokutai (Air Group), Japanese Naval Air-Force, under the command of Major Misaburo Koizumi, decided to undertake night raids on harbour facilities and airfields at Townsville. In all, five raids were planned; three actually occurred.</p>",Echlin Street,West End,historic,Civil defence facility,-19.2668,146.7962,,,,,,,
11243,Temporary Signals Office Townsville,"<p>A Temporary Signals office for the Allied Air Force was located in Francis Street West End in mid 1943. The suburb of West End in Townsville was the location of many hired dwellings by the Australian and US military. Commonwealth documents also reveal plans of several underground air raid shelters and command posts/operations rooms in this suburb. These architectural plans do not indicate how many were actually completed.</p><p>This facility was connected to the RAAF at Garbutt airfield, the No.2 US Air Command Operations and Signals centre at Ramsay Street Garbutt, a Remote Receiving station in Stagpole Street and the RAAF Intelligence and Signals Building in Green and Sidney Streets. These highly secretive installations have left little in the way of documentation in the archives to reveal how they operated. However they were not only responsible for Allied communications, but also the interpretation of intercepted Japanese transmissions.</p><p>The location of the temporary signals was ninety-six yards from the corner of Henry and Francis Street on the left towards Tufley Street.

By early 1943, there were five USN warehouses at Windsor but located on two separate sites. In February 1943, the USN requisitioned Windsor State School for it to become the main Submarine Supply Centre servicing the USN submarine base at New Farm. The Centre administered all of the storage warehouses located across Brisbane until August 1944. The Centre followed the USN north on MacArthur's drive on the Philippines. The site then became a USN receiving station until the Americans closed all the Windsor facilities during September and October 1945.</p>","Windsor State School, 290 Lutwyche Road",Windsor,historic,Supply facility,-27.4313,153.0305,,,,,,,

It contains a system of foxholes with inter-connecting trenches.</p><p>During World War II this area of rainforest was situated between large military encampments at Wondecla, Ravenshoe, Wongabel and Kairi that were occupied at various times by units of the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions, AIF.</p><p>Today the area is on a recent transmission tower access track about 500 metres east of the Kennedy Highway and is hidden in a remnant patch of rainforest south of Mount Hypipamee National Park.</p>",east off Kennedy Highway (north of Longlands Gap Road),Wondecla,historic,Training facility,-17.4557,145.479,,,,,,,
11247,Wondecla Army Entertainment Hall,"<p>A large timber truss igloo theatre was erected on the main Herberton-Evelyn Road (today the Longlands Gap Road) for the troops of the 6th Division. Like similar military camp theatres on the Tableland at Rocky Creek and Danbulla, the Wondecla theatre was about 42 metres in length and 22 metres wide and stood 7.5 metres in height. It was clad in corrugated iron and combined two structural elements-an igloo auditorium with an attached stage area. The igloo was built on a concrete floor slab with two external drains running each side of the building and concrete footings to support the trusses which span the interior space. Each truss is composed of two curved half-trusses which are pinned at the footings and at the apex where they meet. The trusses are made entirely of light pieces of hardwood nailed together and clad with corrugated iron. The stage area is a more conventional timber-frame weatherboard building with a gable roof about 9 metres in height.</p><p>From December 1942 the headquarters of the Australian Army in north Queensland was transferred from Townsville to the Atherton Tableland, with the main administrative centre around the town of Atherton. Units of the Australian 6th and 7th Divisions began arriving on the Tableland in early 1943 and started occupying encampments around the settlements of Wondecla and Ravenshoe. By February and March 1943 a huge schedule of construction work under the direction of the Allied Works Council was underway involving the building of tent encampments, hutments, stores, bakeries, mess kitchens and hospitals.</p><p>Apart from the camp theatre, the only other buildings at the camp were the officers' messes, the store, a canteen, and corrugated iron sheds for the kitchens. The majority of the encampment was set out under canvas tents.

11250,Woodstock Airfields,"<p>The United States (US) 46th Engineer Regiment probably shared work start dates at Woodstock with a part of their unit active a few kilometres northward at Antil Plains. Certainly P-39 Airacobras are recorded using the 104 degrees (most northerly) strip at Woodstock in their transit northward around April 1942.</p><p>Woodstock also had an attractive wide road reserve which was the Charters Towers road and like Antil this strip may have been sited with the object of it masquerading as part of the road. Equally as was the case at Antil, this strip became less used in favour of the southernmost strip bearing approximately 70 degrees magnetic.</p><p>Systematic RAAF airfield record photography over this airfield shows B-25 Mitchell Bombers of the US 345th BG (Air Apaches) on the ground at the eastern end of this strip. Several photos abound pre-dating this mid 1943 photography, showing B-26 aircraft and facilities such as mess buildings.</p><p>Currently an airstrip named Donnington Airpark exists, in what used to be the WWII dispersal areas. The wartime 104 degrees strip was integrated into the highway roadwork shortly after WWII.</p><p>The US 46th Engineers boast a detailed history of their activities in this area which includes a classic photograph of a dance evening within the then CWA hall at Woodstock.

11277,6 (385th) Australian Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) Battery,"<p>When the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour on 7 December 1941, Australia's focus in the war turned to the Pacific. After the raid on Darwin in February 1942, many felt that as Brisbane was the largest city in Queensland, it would be the next to experience a large-scale raid by the Japanese.</p><p>The city was already designated as a staging point, with a significant US build-up underway, and the best port facilities in Queensland. Between March and July 1942 the Japanese conducted regular reconnaissance missions over Cairns and Townsville using long range twin-engine aircraft. Townsville was actually bombed three times in late July and the town of Mossman once. While the Japanese were able to penetrate Australia's defences on these occasions, the May Battle of the Coral Sea prevented Japan from completing its objective of achieving large scale carrier based raids along the Queensland coast.</p>","Caltex Oil Refinery, South Street",Lytton,historic,Fortifications,-27.4131,153.1537,,,,,,,
11278,Horn Island Heavy Anti Aircraft Gun Stations 442 and 443,"<p>The RAAF's Horn Island Advanced Operational Base (AOB) was constructed between late 1939 and 1941 and was upgraded during 1942. The airfield, located at the northeast corner of Horn Island, was an important staging base for Allied air missions against the Japanese, and a stop-over for fighter aircraft heading to New Guinea. The two wartime runways (136 and 81 degrees) have since been upgraded as the Horn Island Airport's runways number 32 and 26 respectively. Surviving elements include some concrete-lined trenches and bunkers located east of the southern section of runway 136; and the aircraft dispersal area extending north-eastward from runway 136, which consists of two taxiway loops with dispersal bays, some protected with earth mounds. Two concrete Bofors gun pits are located on a ridge (known as Bofors Ridge) a kilometre east of the east end of runway 81. The bitumen surface of a wartime runway extension to the west of runway 81 remains intact. The area southwest of the intersection of the two runways contains a section of taxiway and five surviving dispersal bays, a series of concrete lined trenches and four bunkers intended for airfield defence and runway demolition (Strong Point No.1); several light machine gun pits, and 18 identifiable Japanese bomb craters. The site of the Operational Base Unit (OBU) camp is located in bushland immediately south of the airport manager's house and fuel tanks. Airport Road follows the route of most of the taxiway west of the OBU camp. Aircraft wrecks/components near the airfield include two B-17s on the coastline northeast of runway 136; a B-17 east of the east end of runway 81; and a P-47 Thunderbolt near a dispersal bay further to the east. Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) Gun Station 442 occupies the summit of the north-eastern of two small hills that form Double Hill, off Quarry Road, partly on a recent residential allotment. Surviving concrete elements of the gun station comprise a central command post/plotting room (CP); four in-ground octagonal gun emplacements; and three magazines. The fourth magazine has recently been incorporated into the interior of a house. The CP has been adapted as a swimming pool, and the underground plotting room has been sealed. The camp area for Gun Station 442 is located on the hillside 250 metres south-east of the battery. Gun Station 443, approximately 4.8km northeast of GS 442 as the crow flies, occupies an area off King Point Road near the coast of King Point. Surviving concrete elements of the gun station comprise a central CP; four in-ground octagonal gun emplacements, and three magazines. An unidentified building containing a concrete floor slab and underground room forms part of the group. Two of three reinforced concrete magazines are earth covered. The third magazine has been adapted as a dwelling and is occupied. The camp kitchen site for Gun Station 443 is located about 100 metres north-east of the control room.</p>",Double Hill (GS 442) and King Point Road (GS 443),Horn Island,historic,Fortifications,-10.5928,142.2774,,,,,,,

All that is known is in July 1950, the RAAF 87 (Photo Recon) Squadron, flying probably a DeHavilland Mosquito aircraft, took a direct vertical showing clear evidence of two cross strips with further clearing near the junction. As was the recording procedure of the day, a Flight Diagram (FD) was drawn, based on available mapping. A photo located in an obscure part of the National Library of Australia's (NLA) extensive print library, was 'filed' with a similar photo edge marked ""Austin Air Strip"" (sic), taken the day before.</p><p>Upon further investigation at AUSLIG, (now read Geoscience Australia) in Belconnen, ACT, a senior officer presented a number of FDs which had gravitated to them from the RAAF's Central Photographic Establishment (CPE) Laverton Vic. Amongst these were FDs for both Elliot and Austin, which turned out to be Snake Bay on Melville Is near Darwin, NT.</p><p>While research is on-going, at present it appears possible Elliot was cleared during WW2 but with no further advanced, allowing it to return to nature.</p>",Adjacent to old Telegraph line (near Elliot Creek),Elliott,historic,Airfield,-11.2445,142.3815,,,,,,,
